# IV. Creating a User

---

_Note: This section assumes that you are logged in as a user with Administrator privileges._

1. Click on Admin Tools (gear icon), and choose the Security tab. Users section automatically gets selected. Alternatively, you can go to http://<dataikuhost>:<port>/admin/security/users/

    &nbsp;

2. Click on New User button. In the New User panel that will appear, fill up the general and password fields. Select the appropriate group for the new user. By default, Dataiku DSS has three groups with different privileges: administration, data_team, and readers. New groups can also be added in the Groups pane of the Security tab. Set the new user profile to Data Scientist. This will allow him/her to run code-based recipes (Python, Râ€¦)
