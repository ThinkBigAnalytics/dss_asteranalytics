Dataiku Data Science Studio \(DSS\) is a collaborative platform that enables teams of people with different data expertise, such as data engineers, data scientists and analysts, to work together efficiently. Dataiku DSS provides a set of built-in recipes or operations that can be applied to transform or analyse a dataset. It also allows users to create their own recipes in Python, SQL or R. Custom reusable recipes for Dataiku are called plugins and can only be written in Python.

Dataiku provides a platform that allows to visualize and re-run workflows. In a Dataiku project, one can easily visualize how data flows across tables and recipes.

Aster Analytics Plugin for Dataiku DSS integrates around 150 Aster Analytics SQL-MR functions to Dataiku data science studio. SQL-MR functions can be accessed through the RECIPE menu of the FLOW view of a Dataiku project, and are grouped into nine categories:

* Time Series, Path and Attribution Analysis
* Ensemble Methods
* Text Analysis
* Na√Øve Bayes
* Graph Analysis
* Association Analysis
* Statistical Analysis
* Cluster Analysis
* Data Transformation

Aster Analytics Plugin provides a user interface-based way of building SQL-MR queries to be sent to an Aster database. Input and output managed datasets are located in the connected Aster database. All SQL-MR queries are also executed in-database.
